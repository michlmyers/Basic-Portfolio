            Growing up outside of Philadelphia I was always interested in music. After experimenting with multiple 
            instruments I eventually settled on the drumset. I began to write music and play in local bands before 
            being accepted to Berklee College of Music, in Boston, and majoring in their Music Business program.  
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating from Berklee I moved to New York to land a job on the business side of the music industry,
            working with performing rights organizations, radio, and record labels. During this time I have continued to 
            remain interested in my creative side by writing music with local bands. Web development is a natural 
            expansion of my creative and business experience for the next stage in my life. Currently residing in Jersey City
            with my wife and dog.
